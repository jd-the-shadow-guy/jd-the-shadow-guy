## Hey there 👋  

I'm **JD**, an engineering student obsessed with Linux, system automation, and building efficient workflows that actually solve real problems.  
I believe in discipline, simplicity, and mastering the fundamentals — one shell script at a time.

## 🧰 What I Work On  
- Linux system administration (Ubuntu / RHEL)  
- Bash scripting & automation  
- Networking essentials (TCP/IP, firewalls, SSH, troubleshooting)  
- Building small but high–leverage tools to make infrastructure smoother  
- Strengthening my DevOps foundations (Git, CI/CD basics, cloud fundamentals)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech I Use  
- **Linux**, Bash, Git/GitHub  
- VirtualBox, Docker (learning), AWS CLI (basic)  
- Wireshark, Nmap, Autopsy  
- Python for scripting logic  
- VS Code / Nano (depends on the mood 😄)

---

## 📌 Current Focus  
- Mastering Linux & automation for real-world SysAdmin/DevOps work  
- Building hands-on projects like:  
  - Automated Desktop Setup Script  
  - System backup utilities  
  - Network troubleshooting helpers  
- Preparing for cybersecurity + DevOps career path

## 🧩 A Bit About Me  
- I like building things that are **simple, clean, and useful**  
- Automation-first mindset: if I do it twice, I script it  
- Deep into discipline, consistency, and skill-building  
- Calisthenics athlete — train every day, just like I train my mind  
- On a long-term mission to become the best version of myself
