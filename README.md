## Hey there! 👋

I'm JD, an engineering student focused on Linux, automation, and building reliable systems.

If a task repeats, chances are I’ll script it. I love designing small tools that make workflows smoother and systems easier to manage.

My main tech stack is Linux, Bash, Git/GitHub, and virtualization. I’m currently learning Docker and DevOps fundamentals.  
My favorite tools right now are Bash, VirtualBox, and Wireshark.

Most of my projects are automation-focused — setup scripts, backup utilities, and troubleshooting helpers. Everything I build is from scratch.

If you want to connect or talk Linux, reach me @:

- Automation-first mindset  
- Love building things that are simple, clean, and useful  
- Strong fundamentals > fancy tools
